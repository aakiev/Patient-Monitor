# Patient Monitor

## Overview
This repository hosts a WPF-based application developed as part of the "Softwaretechnik" module. The "Patient Monitor" application is designed to provide real-time monitoring of patient data, including advanced features such as Fourier transformation, database integration, and medical image visualization. Built using C# and the .NET framework, it aims to offer a comprehensive solution for healthcare data management and analysis.

The modular architecture ensures flexibility and scalability, making the project ideal for exploring medical data processing concepts and practical applications.

## Key Objectives
- Real-time visualization of patient data in dynamic charts.
- Implementation of Fourier transformation for signal analysis.
- Integration with a database for storing and retrieving patient information.
- Visualization of medical imaging data, such as MRI scans.

## Core Features
1. **Real-Time Patient Data Monitoring**
   - Dynamic charts display live patient data.
   - Easy-to-use interface for continuous monitoring.

2. **Fourier Transformation**
   - Perform Fourier analysis on patient signals to identify patterns and anomalies.

3. **Database Integration**
   - Store and manage patient records securely.
   - Retrieve data efficiently for analysis and reporting.

4. **Medical Image Viewer**
   - Load and display medical images, such as MRI scans.
   - Support for zooming, panning, and basic image manipulation.

5. **Extensibility**
   - Modular design allows for easy integration of additional features or modules.
